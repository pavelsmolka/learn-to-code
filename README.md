Learn to Code
=============

Series of 10 learning lessons, covering basics of programming using PHP.

Originally, the lessons in this course were created only as a teacher's reference.
They are not designed to be a sufficient material for self-learning, but they
should be helpful for anyone designing a similar coding course.

The practical examples and homework assignments are tailored to the
specifics of our team at Future plc, for which I have created this course.
