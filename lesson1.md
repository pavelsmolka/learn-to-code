Lesson 1
========

Theory
------
 - foreign language => learn and you can tell other people what you want
 - program, source code, language of computers
 - necessary to be very specific
 - algorithm - structured way of telling computer what to do (no magic!)
 - computer will not do anything you do not tell it (including stuff like machine learning)

Hands on
--------
 - pen and paper (this is how every real programmer starts!)
 - algorithms using English language, including "keywords" (if, else, while, x times, naming repeated complex actions)
 - be careful, you can only use very simple actions (ideally atomic, such as "one step")
 - sequential algorithm: How does one get to see the film "Hobbit"? (http://www.scifac.ru.ac.za/javabook/ch02.htm)
 - conditional statements: if "Hobbit" is not showing, find something else to do, else go to the cinema... (^^)
 - loop: Check the row number, move to the next row if not matching.

Homework
--------
 - write down algorithms for (no googling):
   - ??? (easy)
   - find maximum of a long list of numbers (moderate)
   - find an average of a long list of numbers (difficult)
   - determine whether a word is a palindrome (difficult)
